    <h1>Some of My Works this Semester.</h1>
</header>

<p>Here is a list of selected works I have worked on during this semester:</p>

<h3 id="work1"><%= link_to "sa8-act2: Ruby classes", "https://github.com/Spongehubman/sa8-act2" %></h3>
<p>Each of the files in this repository focuses on an aspect of Ruby classes and methods. I really liked <br>
learning how to use them.</p><br>


<h3 id="work2"><%= link_to "TDD-Based Poker Game (Midterm Project)", "https://github.com/Spongehubman/midterm-project" %></h3>
<p>This project took advantage of using the TDD development method to creating a poker game. <br>
This I really liked working on this poker gamem, and it was fun to play as well. Unfortunately, <br>
this game only properly works with "full house" and "four-of-a-kind" hands, but the prinicple is the same.</p><br>

<h3 id="work3"><%= link_to "sa11-act2: Practice Using Regular Expressions (in Ruby)", "https://github.com/Spongehubman/sa11-act2" %></h3>
<p>This was the first of two assignments involving the use of Regular Expressions (Regex), and it <br>
really helped me in getting used to using regular expression commands in Ruby files.</p><br>

<h3 id="work4"><%= link_to "sa15-act1: Quiz Webpage Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript", "https://github.com/Spongehubman/sa15-act1"%></h3>
<p>This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a quiz webpage based on material from this course. <br>
I really liked making this project, as it helped me to remember (if not learn) how to use radio button sets in <br>
which only one can be selected; it also helped me to get used to insertting text in HTML documents using JavaScript.<br>
How many questions can <i>you</i> answer correctly?</p><br>
